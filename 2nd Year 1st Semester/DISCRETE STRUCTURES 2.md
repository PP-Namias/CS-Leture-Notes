matrix in the program want ni sir
- can be solve in manual so can exam with pencil and paper

program side output
solve the topic using manual method u translate the manual to a program na (gawa mo)

midterm and final; exam included on the activites (sa mga outputs nagagawin natin)

all algorithim ouput lang

disscuss the solution sa atin
[*probably with groups 2 or 3 mins*]


examinations will focus on programing part natin :)

- permutations 
- combination
- penguin hold prensiple (para sa mga probabilistic)

next meeting class for futher disscussion
